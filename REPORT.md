I have successfully added the "Sync Now" button and the "Source Name" text input field to the settings tab.

### Summary of completed work:
-   **Feature Re-implementation:** I have re-implemented the vault sync feature as a manual process. This included adding the back-end logic to handle the synchronization and creating the necessary UI elements for user interaction.
-   **UI Integration:** The "Sync Now" button and "Source Name" field are now integrated into the plugin's settings tab, allowing users to configure and trigger the sync process.

### What's left:
-   **Verification:** The new functionality needs to be tested to ensure it works correctly. This involves running the plugin, configuring the source name, and using the "Sync Now" button to confirm that files are successfully uploaded.
